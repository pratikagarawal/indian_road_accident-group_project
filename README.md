AcciDetect is a machine learning project that predicts road accident severity (Minor, Major, Deadly, Injured) using features like speed, impact force, weather, and road conditions. Models including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and KNN were tested, with RF and XGBoost achieving ~90% accuracy, aiding smarter road safety and emergency response.
